![pacman cx](https://github.com/galah4d/casino-cx/blob/master/screenshots/main-screen.png)

Casino CX is a CX application featuring multiple popular casino games such as:

  - Slots (Under development)
  - Blackjack (Coming soon)
  - Roulette (Coming soon)
  - Dices (Coming soon)

# What is CX?
CX is a general purpose, interpreted and compiled programming language, with a very strict type system and a syntax similar to Golang's. CX provides a new programming paradigm based on the concept of affordances, where the user can ask the programming language at runtime what can be done with a CX object (functions, expressions, packages, etc.), and interactively or automatically choose one of the affordances to be applied.

You can find more info on:
  - The github page on CX - https://github.com/skycoin/cx
  - The official website of Skycoin - https://www.skycoin.net/

After installing [CX](https://github.com/skycoin/cx) and all its dependencies clone this repository by running:
