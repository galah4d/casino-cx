![casino cx](https://github.com/galah4d/casino-cx/blob/master/screenshots/slots-screen.png)

Casino CX is a CX application featuring multiple popular casino games such as:

  - Slots (Under development)
  - Blackjack (Coming soon)
  - Roulette (Coming soon)
  - Dices (Coming soon)

# What is CX?
CX is a general purpose, interpreted and compiled programming language, with a very strict type system and a syntax similar to Golang's. CX provides a new programming paradigm based on the concept of affordances, where the user can ask the programming language at runtime what can be done with a CX object (functions, expressions, packages, etc.), and interactively or automatically choose one of the affordances to be applied.

You can find more info on:
  - The github page on CX - https://github.com/skycoin/cx
  - The official website of Skycoin - https://www.skycoin.net/

# Installation
Casino CX requires the latest version of [CX](https://github.com/skycoin/cx) to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.
After installing [CX](https://github.com/skycoin/cx) and all its dependencies clone this repository by running:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/galah4d/casino-cx.git
```

Wait for the cloning process to finish and navigate to the cloned directory...

```sh
$ cd casino-cx/casino/
```

The game should be ready to run.

# Running the game
In order to run the game type the following command:

```sh
$ cx graphical.cx slots.cx main.cx
```

The navigation between menus is done using the mouse to select a button, and
pressing ENTER to confirm the selection(currently CX doesn't support mouse click activities).

Thank you Skycoin community!

# Disclamer
Do NOT send funds to the app in order to gamble!
Currently it is not possible to gamble in the app as CX is still not able to interact with Fiber's blockchain,
CX's development roadmap is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skycoin/cx/master/cx-roadmap.png).
I am not part of the team responsible for the development of the CX programming language.
